title: Globally small fibrations

In ordinary category theory, a category $C$ is called *small* when the objects
of $C$ can be arranged into a set, and so can for every $x,y\in C$ the
collection of morphisms $x\to y$. It is useful to separate these two conditions
when we generalize them to fibrations. The latter is called *local smallness*
and is discussed and defined in {%ref 000F%}; the former is called *global
smallness* by Jacobs and factors through an important concept: the *generic object*.

**Definition.** An ordinary category is called *globally small* when it has a set of objects.
