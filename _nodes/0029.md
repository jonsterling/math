title: An alternative definition of fibration
macrolib: topos
---

**Warning.** Some authors including Grothendieck {%cite sga:1 -A%} give an
equivalent definition of cartesian fibration that factors through a
*nonequivalent* definition of cartesian morphisms. Such authors refer to our
notion of cartesian morphism as *hypercartesian* {%cite streicher:2018%}.

@include{002A}

Cartesian morphisms are clearly hypocartesian (setting $u=x$ and $m=\Idn{x}$),
but the converse does not hold.
