title: An alternative definition of fibration
macrolib: topos
---

**Warning.** Some authors including Grothendieck {%cite sga:1 -A%} give an
equivalent definition of cartesian fibration that factors through a
*nonequivalent* definition of cartesian morphisms. Such authors refer to our
notion of cartesian morphism as *hypercartesian* {%cite streicher:2018%}.

@include{002A}

Cartesian morphisms are clearly hypocartesian (setting $u=x$ and $m=\Idn{x}$),
but the converse does not hold. The problem is that in an arbitrary displayed
category, hypocartesian morphisms may not be closed under composition.

@include{002C}

Grothendieck {%cite sga:1 -A%} defines a fibration in terms of (what we refer
to as) hypocartesian morphisms rather than (what we refer to as) cartesian
morphisms, and therefore imposes the additional constraint that the
hypocartesian morphisms be closed under composition. In {%ref 002C%} below, we
verify that these two definitions of cartesian fibration coincide.
