title: Bénabou's notion of definability
---

We will now construe {%cref 002Q%} as the instantiation at the fundamental
self-indexing $\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}$ of a more general notion of
definability for classes of objects in a cartesian fibration, defined
forthwith. The following definition of definability in a cartesian fibration is due to Bénabou, but is discussed in print by Borceux {%cite borceux:1994:vol2 -A%}, Jacobs {%cite jacobs:1999 -A%}, Streicher {%cite streicher:2018 -A%}.
