title: Separating family for a category
taxon: definition
---

Given an ordinary category $E$, a set-indexed family
$\prn{s\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}$ of $E$-objects is called a *small separating
family* for $E$ when, assuming that for all $i\in I$ and all $u:s_i\to x$ we have
$u;f=u;g$, we then have $f=g$.
