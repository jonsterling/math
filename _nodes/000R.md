In our foundation we have a notions of *class* and *set*. When we speak
informally of "collections of things", we are referring to classes; therefore,
a "category" for us is one with a class of objects, and a class of morphisms
from any one object to another. It is routine to define a class to be a formula
in the language of set theory; we take a more agnostic approach and just say
that classes are whatever is on the "outside".

**Explanation.** A *class* $\Phi$ is defined by a specification of how to
construct an element of $\Phi$, and when two elements of $\Phi$ are considered
equal.

Hence we assume the ability to take quotients of classes.

**Assumption.** We assume that there exists a category $\SET$ satisfying the axioms of
[ETCS](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ETCS); a *set* for us is then an object of
the category $\SET$.
