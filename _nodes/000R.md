title: Foundational assumptions

@include{001F}

In our definition above, we have not imposed any restrictions on what kinds of
things the objects and morphisms are; our definition is pre-mathematical, so we
do not assume beforehand that there is a such thing as a collection of "all"
meta-categories.

**Remark.** We may define analogous notions of meta-functor, etc. But we do not
assume that the notion of "all meta-functors $\mathfrak{C}\to\mathfrak{D}$" is
well-defined; the notion is entirely schematic.


**Assumption.** We assume a meta-category $\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Coll}}$ whose
objects we will refer to as "collections". We assume that the meta-category of all collections satisfies the axioms of Lawvere's [ETCS](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ETCS).

Consequently there exists a meta-category $\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Cat}}$ of all
categories. Following [Lawvere](http://rfcwalters.blogspot.com/2010/10/old-post-why-are-we-concerned-fw.html) (but deviating from some other authors that
ground the notion of meta-categories in *classes*) we notice that
$\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Cat}}$ is cartesian closed; in other words, all functor
categories exist regardless of size.

**Assumption.** At times we may assume that there exists a *category*
$\SET\subseteq\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Coll}}$ of collections that we will refer
to as sets, such that $\SET$ is closed under the axioms of
[ETCS](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ETCS). Rather than work with $\SET$ at all
times, our approach is to use the tools of relative category theory to
objectify the notions of "small" and "locally small" category over any category
$B$, generalizing the role of $\SET$ from classical category theory.
