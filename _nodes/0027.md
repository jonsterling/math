title: Relative and fibered geometric universes

Just as it is important to study *relative* categories in addition to
absolute categories, the same is true of geometric universes. The main way
for a geometric universe $F$ to vary in a geometric universe $E$ is for it
to be equipped with a structure map $f : E \to F$. This should at first be slightly counter-intuitive, because usually we think of something varying *over* rather than *under* a base. The reason for the present orientation will become more clear when we study below the relative geometric universe $f : E \to F$ in terms of a *fibered* category in the sense of {%ref 0002%}.

The gluing fibration $\GL{f}$ provides a solid intuition for the way in which
$F$ varies in $E$: we are concerned with the variation of families of
$F$-objects indexed in $E$ objects.
