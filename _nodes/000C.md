title: Relationship to Street's fibrations
---

In classical category theory, fibrations are defined by
Grothendieck {%cite sga:1 -A%} to be certain functors $E\to B$ such that any morphism $f:x\to Pv$
in $B$ lies strictly underneath a cartesian morphism in $E$. As we have
discussed, this condition cannot be formulated unless equality is meaningful
for the collection of objects of $B$.

There is an alternative definition of fibration {%cite street:1980%} that avoids
equality of objects; here we require for each $f:x\to Pv$ a cartesian morphism
$h:\InvImg{f}v \to v$ together with an isomorphism $\phi : P(\InvImg{f}v)\cong x$
such that $\phi^{-1};Ph = f$.

By unrolling definitions, it is not difficult to see that the displayed
category $P\Sub{\bullet}$ is a fibration in our sense if and only if the functor
$P:E\to B$ was a fibration in Street's sense. Moreover, it can be seen that the
Grothendieck construction yields a *Grothendieck* fibration
$\TotCat{P\Sub{\bullet}}\to B$; hence we have introduced by accident a convenient
destription of the *strictification* of Street fibrations into equivalent
Grothendieck fibrations.
