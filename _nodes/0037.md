title: 2-categories of geometric universes
taxon: definition
---

Each of the different notions of geometric universe above gives rise to a 2-category. We will fix our conventions below:

1. $\PCartGU$ is the 2-category of geometric universes, partial cartesian morphisms, and natural transformations between them.
2. $\CartGU$ is the 2-category of geometric universes, cartesian morphisms, and natural transformations between them.
3. $\LogGU$ is the locally groupoidal 2-category of geometric universes, logical morphisms, and natural isomorphisms between them.
4. $\AlgGU$ is the 2-category of geometric universes and algebraic morphisms $f = (\InvImg{f}\dashv\DirImg{f})$, such that a 2-morphism $f \to g$ is given by a natural transformation $\InvImg{f}\to\InvImg{g}$.
