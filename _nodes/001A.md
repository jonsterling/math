Let $E$ be a category with finite limits; then an _internal category_
in $E$ is defined by the following data:

1. an object of objects $C\Sub{0}\in E$,
2. an object of morphisms $C\Sub{1}\in E$,
3. source and target morphisms $s,t:C\Sub{1}\to C\Sub{0}$,
4. a generic identity morphism $C\Sub{0}\to C\Sub{1}$,
5. a generic composition morphism $C\Sub{1}\times\Sub{C\Sub{0}}C\Sub{1}\to C\Sub{1}$,
6. satisfying a number of laws corresponding to those of a category.

For the details of these laws, we refer to the [nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+category).
