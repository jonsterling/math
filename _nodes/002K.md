Let $E$ be a cartesian fibration and let $\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}\subseteq E$ be the full subfibration determined by a displayed object $\bar{s}\in E$ as in {%cref 0010%}. We now develop the following vocabulary:

1. We will refer to each object of $\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}$ as a $\bar{s}$-figure
shape.

2. A displayed morphism $\bar{z}\to \bar{x}$ is called a $\bar{s}$-figure
   whenever $\bar{z}\in\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}$.
