A *meta-category* $\mathfrak{C}$ is defined by explaining what
an object of $\mathfrak{E}$ is, and, given two objects $x,y\in \mathfrak{E}$,
what a morphism from $x$ to $y$ is, together with the following operations:

1. for each object $x\in \mathfrak{E}$, an *identity* map $\Idn{x} : x \to x$,
2. for any two maps $f:x\to y$ and $g:y\to z$, a *composite map* $f;g : x \to z$,
3. such that the following equations hold:
\\[
  \Idn{x};h = h\qquad
  h;\Idn{y} = h\qquad
  f;(g;h) = (f;g);{h}
\\]
