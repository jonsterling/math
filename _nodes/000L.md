**Theorem.** An ordinary category $C$ is equivalent to a globally small category if and only if the fibration $\FAM{C}$ has a generic object.

**Proof.**
To see that this is the case, suppose that $C$ has a set of objects. Then
$C\in\SET$ and we define $\lfloor{C}\rfloor$ to be the displayed object
$\brc{x}\Sub{x\in C}\in \FAM{C}[C]$. Fixing $I\in \SET$ and $z\in C^I$, we
consider the cartesian map displayed over $z : I \to C$:
«
\DiagramSquare{
  height = 1.5cm,
  width = 3cm,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  sw = I,
  se = C,
  south = z,
  ne = \brc{x}\Sub{x\in C},
  nw = {z = \brc{z\,i}\Sub{i\in I} }
}
»

Conversely assume that $\FAM{C}$ has a generic object $\bar{u}\in\FAM{C}[U]$
for some $U\in \SET$; then we may equip $U$ with the structure of a globally
small category such that $U$ is equivalent to $C$, using a construction that is similar to our implementation of the opposite fibration {%ref 000Q%}. In particular we define a
morphism $x\to y\in U$ to be given by the following data:

1. a cartesian map $a\to\Sub{x} \bar{u}$ over $x : 1\to U$,
2. a cartesian map $b\to\Sub{y} \bar{u}$ over $y : 1\to U$,
3. and a vertical map $h:a\to b$ in $\FAM{C}[1]\simeq C$,

such that $(a\Sub{1},b\Sub{1},h\Sub{1})$ is identified with $(a\Sub{2},b\Sub{2},h\Sub{2})$ when $h_1$ and $h_2$ are equal modulo the (unique) vertical isomorphisms between the cartesian lifts in the sense depicted below:
«
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \SpliceDiagramSquare{
    nw = a_1,
    ne = a_2,
    sw = b_1,
    se = b_2,
    north = \cong,
    south = \cong,
    west = h_1,
    east = h_2,
    east/node/style = upright desc,
  }
  \node (u) [between = ne and se, xshift = 2cm] {$\bar{u}$};
  \draw[->] (ne) to node [sloped,above] {cart.}(u);
  \draw[->] (se) to node [sloped,below] {cart.} (u);
\end{tikzpicture}
»

Remember that a cartesian map $a\to\Sub{x}\bar{u}$ is standing for a *choice*
of an object of $C$ encoded by $x\in U$. Because such choices are unique only
up to isomorphism, we must include them explicitly in the data.

**Note.** To define the category $U$ above, we have used our assumption that
*classes* are closed under quotients {% ref 000R %}.
