Note that any geometric universe has finite colimits, which can be constructed using the subobject classifier.

@include{0036}

A logical morphism between geometric universes necessarily preserves finite colimits, as these can be constructed from the subobject classifier. Using Freyd's characterization of natural numbers objects in terms of a coequalization property, it follows that logical morphisms also preserve the natural numbers object.
