Any ordinary category $C$ can be viewed as a displayed category $\FAM{C}$ over $\SET$:

1. For $S\in \SET$, object in $\FAM{C}[S]$ is specified by a functor $C^S$
   where $S$ is regarded as a discrete category.
2. Given $f : S \to T$ in $\SET$ and $x\in C^S$ and $y\in C^T$, a morphism
   $x \to\Sub{f} y$ is given by a morphism $\InvImg{f}x\to y$ in $C^S$ where
   $\InvImg{f} : C^T \to C^S$ is precomposiiton with $f$.

The displayed category $\FAM{C}$ is in fact a cartesian fibration. This family
fibration is the starting point for developing a *relative* form of category
theory, the purpose of this lecture. By analogy with viewing an ordinary
category $C$ as a fibration $\FAM{C}$ over $\SET$, we may reasonably define a
"relative category" over another base $B$ to be a fibration over $B$.

This story for relative category theory reflects the way that ordinary
categories are "based on" $\SET$ in some sense in spite of the fact that they
do not necessarily have sets of objects or even sets of morphisms between
objects. Being small and locally small respectively will later be seen to be
properties of a family fibration over an arbitrary base $B$, strictly
generalizing the classical notions.
