title: Full subfibrations and figure shapes

In a category $E$, a morphism $f : x\to y$ can be thought of as a "figure"
of shape $x$ valued in $y$. For instance, if $x$ is the point (i.e.
$x=\ObjTerm{E}$) then a morphism $x\to y$ is a "point" of the "space" $y$.
We refer to $x$ as the figure-shape in any such scenario.
The perspective of morphisms as figures is developed in more detail by Lawvere and Schanuel {%cite lawvere-schanuel:2009 -A%}.

It often happens that there a useful class of figure shapes can be arranged
into a *set*-indexed family $\prn{u\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}$; viewed from the
perspective of the family fibration {%pref 0006%}, this family is just a
displayed object $\bar{u}$ over $I$ and then a figure shape relative to
this family is given by any cartesian morphism $\bar{z}\to\bar{u}$. We will
generalize this situation to the case of an arbitrary fibration, by
constructing the full subfibration spanned by displayed objects equipped
with a cartesian morphism into $\bar{u}$.
