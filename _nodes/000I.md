title: The definition of local smallness
---

Based on our explorations above, we are now prepared to write down (and
understand) the proper definition of local smallness for an arbitrary fibration
$E$ over $B$, which should be thought of as a (potentially large) category
relative to $B$.

For any $x\in B$ and displayed objects $u,v\in E\Sub{x}$, we define a *hom
candidate* for $u,v$ to be a span $u\leftarrow \bar{h} \rightarrow v$ in $E$ in which the left-hand leg is cartesian:
«
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
\SpliceDiagramSquare<l/>{
  height = 1.5cm,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  north/style = <-,
  south/style = <-,
  ne/style = ne pullback,
  ne = \bar{h},
  se = h,
  sw = x,
  nw = u,
  south = p\Sub{h},
  north = \bar{p}\Sub{h}
}
\SpliceDiagramSquare<r/>{
  height = 1.5cm,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  glue = west,
  glue target = l/,
  ne = v,
  se = x,
  north = \epsilon\Sub{h},
  south = p\Sub{h},
}
\end{tikzpicture}
»

In the above, $h$ should be thought of as a candidate for the "hom object" of $u,v$,
and $\epsilon\Sub{h}$ should be viewed as the structure of an "evaluation map" for $h$.
This structure can be rephrased in terms of a displayed category $\CandHom{x}{u}{v}$ over $\Sl{B}{x}$:

1. Given $h\in \Sl{B}{x}$, an object of $\CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{h}$ is given by a hom candidate
   whose apex in the base is $h$ itself. We will write $\bar{h}$ metonymically
   for the entire hom candidate over $h$.

2. Given $\alpha:l\to h\in\Sl{B}{x}$ and hom candidates $\bar{l}\in \CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{l}$ and
   $\bar{h}\in \CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{h}$, a morphism $\bar{h}\to\Sub{\alpha} \bar{l}$ is given by a
   cartesian morphism $\bar\alpha:\bar{l}\to\Sub{\alpha}\bar{h}$ in $E$ such that the
   following diagram commutes:
   «
   \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
     \node (u) {$u$};
     \node (l) [above right = 1.5cm of u,xshift=.5cm] {$\bar{l}$};
     \node (h) [below right = 1.5cm of u,xshift=.5cm] {$\bar{h}$};
     \node (v) [below right = 1.5cm of l,xshift=.5cm] {$v$};
     \draw[->] (h) to node [sloped,below] {$\bar{p}\Sub{h}$} (u);
     \draw[->] (l) to node [sloped,above] {$\bar{p}\Sub{l}$} (u);
     \draw[->] (h) to node [sloped,below] {$\epsilon\Sub{h}$} (v);
     \draw[->] (l) to node [sloped,above] {$\epsilon\Sub{l}$} (v);
     \draw[->] (l) to node [upright desc] {$\bar\alpha$} (h);
   \end{tikzpicture}
   »

**Definition.** A fibration $E$ over $B$ is *locally small* if and only if for
each $x\in B$ and $u,v\in E\Sub{x}$, the total category $\TotCat{\CandHom{x}{u}{v}}$
has a terminal object.
