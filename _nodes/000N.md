title: Small fibrations and internal categories
---

The purpose of this section is to develop the relationship between *internal
categories* (categories defined in the internal language of a category $B$) and
cartesian fibrations over $B$, generalizing the relationship between categories internal
to $\SET$ (i.e. small categories) and their family fibrations over $\SET$.

We have already seen in {%cref 000G%} and {%cref 000L%} that smallness in the
sense of the definition above appropriately generalizes the ordinary notion of
smallness for categories over $\SET$. Another perspective on smallness is given
by the *internal language*, in which a category is viewed as an algebra for the
"theory of categories" computed in another category with enough structure. The
notion of internal categories is credited (independently) to Alexander
Grothendieck and Charles Ehresmann.
