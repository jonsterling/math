Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a model of {%nlab ETCS%}; and let $\mathfrak{C}$ be a
class of families of sets in $\mathscr{M}$. Then $\mathfrak{C}$ is a class of
objects in the fundamental self-indexing $\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}$ over
$\mathscr{M}$.  Furthermore, $\mathscr{M}$ a definable class in
$\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}$ in the sense of {%cref 002W%} if and only if it is a
definable class of families of sets in the sense of {%cref 002P%}.
