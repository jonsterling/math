title: Cartesian lifts in the opposite category
---

The foreging characterization {%ref 000T%} of cartesian maps in $\OpCat{E}$
immediately implies that $\OpCat{E}$ is fibered over $B$.

**Corollary.** The displayed category $\OpCat{E}$ is a fibration.

**Proof.**
Fixing $\bar{y}\in \OpCat{E}\Sub{y}$ and $f:x\to y\in B$, we must
exhibit a cartesian lift $\bar{f} : \bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}\in \OpCat{E}$.
By the characterization {%ref 000T%} it suffices to find *any* map over $f$ whose vertical component is an isomorphism. Writing $\bar{y}\Sub{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$ for the cartesian lift of $f$ in $E$, consider the map in $\OpCat{E}$ presented by the following span in $E$:
«
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \SpliceDiagramSquare<l/>{
    nw = \bar{y}\Sub{x},
    ne = \bar{y}\Sub{x},
    sw = x,
    se = x,
    north/style = double,
    south/style = double,
    west/style = lies over,
    east/style = lies over,
    ne/style = pullback,
    height = 1.5cm,
  }
  \SpliceDiagramSquare<r/>{
    glue = west,
    glue target = l/,
    height = 1.5cm,
    east/style = lies over,
    ne = \bar{y},
    se = y,
    south = f,
  }
\end{tikzpicture}
