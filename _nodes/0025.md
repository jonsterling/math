Let $E$ be a geometric universe. A $E$-*topos* $X$ or a *topos in
$E$* is defined to be a geometric universe $\Sh{X}$ equipped with a structure
map $X:E\to\Sh{X}$ whose gluing fibration $\GL{X}$ has a
generating family. A morphism of $E$-topoi $f:{X}\to{Y}$ is defined by a
morphism $\Sh{f}:\Sh{Y}\to\Sh{X}$ of geometric universes equipped with
a 2-isomorphism $\phi_{f}:\Sh{f}\circ Y\cong X$ in $[E,\Sh{X}]$.

A 2-morphism $\alpha:{f}\to{g}$ in $[X,Y]$ is defined to be a
2-morphism $\alpha:\Sh{f}\to{\Sh{g}}$ compatible with $\phi_{f},\phi_{g}$
in the sense that the following pasting diagrams are equal:
