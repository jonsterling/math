title: Displayed and fibered functors
---

Let $E$ be displayed over $B$ and let $F$ be displayed over $C$. If $U:B \to C$
is an ordinary functor, than a *displayed functor* from $E$ to $F$ over $U$ is
given by the following data:

1. for each displayed object $\bar{x}\in E\Sub{x}$, a displayed object $\bar{U}\bar{x}\in F\Sub{Ux}$,
2. for each displayed morphism $\bar{f} : \bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$, a displayed morphism $\bar{U}\bar{f} : \bar{U}\bar{x}\to\Sub{Uf}\bar{U}\bar{y}$,
3. such that the assignment $\bar{U}f$ preserves displayed identities and displayed composition.

From this notion, we can see the variation of displayed categories over their
base categories itself has a "displayed categorical" structure; up to size
issues, we could speak of the displayed *bicategory* of displayed categories.

**Note.** The correct notion of morphism between cartesian fibrations is given
by displayed functors that preserve cartesian maps. We will call these *fibered
functors*.
