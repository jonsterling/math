title: The internalization of a small fibration

Let $C$ be a small cartesian fibration {%ref 000N%} over $B$ a category with finite
limits, i.e. a cartesian fibration that is both locally small {%ref 000I%} and globally
small {%ref 000P%}. We will show that $C$ is equivalent to the externalization
{%ref 000V%} of an internal category {%ref 000O%} $\underline{C}$ in $B$,
namely the the full internal subcategory {%ref 0011%} associated to the generic
object $\bar{u}\in C$.

By {%ref 0011%} we know that the externalization of $\underline{C}$ so-defined
is equivalent to the full subfibration $\FullSubfib{\bar{u}}$ of $C$ spanned by
objects that are "classified" by $\bar{u}$. Because $\bar{u}$ is generic, we
know that *every* object of $C$ is classified by $\bar{u}$, so we are done.
