title: "Example: Revisiting the fundamental self-indexing"
---

Recall that the fundamental self-indexing $\SelfIx{B}$ {%pref 001X %} of a category $B$
is a displayed category with $\SelfIx{B}\Sub{x} = \Sl{B}{x}$.
As discussed in {%cref 001Y %}, $\SelfIx{B}$ is a cartesian fibration over $B$ if and
only if $B$ has pullbacks. However, $\SelfIx{B}$ is unconditionally a *cocartesian*
fibration.
