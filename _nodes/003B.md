Streicher has pointed out {%cite streicher:2017:fibered-top -A %} that the following are equivalent for a logical fibration {%ref 003A%} of geometric universes:

1. The total category $\TotCat{E}$ is a geometric universe and the projection $\TotCat{E}\to B$ is a logical morphism.
2. The fibration $E$ has small sums over $B$, i.e. $E$ is an *cocartesian fibration* {%pref 0017%} and a certain Beck-Chevalley condition holds for cocartesian
