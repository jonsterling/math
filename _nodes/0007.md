title: Change of base

Suppose that $E$ is displayed over $B$ and $F : X\to B$ is a
functor; then we may define a displayed category $\InvImg{F}E$ as over $X$ follows:

1. An object of $(\InvImg{F}E)\Sub{x}$ is an object of $E\Sub{Fx}$.

2. Given $\bar{x}\in (\InvImg{F}E)\Sub{x}$, $\bar{y}\in (\InvImg{F}E)\Sub{y}$ and $f : x
   \to y$, a morphism $\bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$ in $\InvImg{F}E$ is given by a morphism $\bar{x}\to\Sub{Ff}\bar{y}$ in $E$.

We visualize the change of base scenario as follows:
«
\DiagramSquare{
  nw/style = pullback,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  height = 1.5cm,
  nw = \InvImg{F}{E},
  ne = E,
  sw = X,
  se = B,
  south = F,
}
