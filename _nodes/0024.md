Dually to {%ref 0003 %}, every category $B$ can also be displayed over itself via its
*coslices*. That is, for any category $B$, we define a displayed category
$\overline{B}$ over $B$ as follows:
1. For $x\in B$, define $\overline{B}\Sub{x}$ as the collection of pairs
   $(\bar{x}\in B,p\Sub{x}:x\to\bar{x})$.
2. For $f : x\to y\in B$, define $\overline{B}\Sub{f}$ to be the collection of
   commuting squares in the following configuration:
«
  \DiagramSquare{
    height = 1.7cm,
    sw = \bar{x},
    se = \bar{y},
    nw = x,
    ne = y,
    west = p\Sub{x},
    east = p\Sub{y},
    south = \bar{f},
    north = f,
    west/style = {->,exists},
    east/style = {->,exists},
    south/style = {->,exists},
  }

**Exercise.** Prove that $\overline{B}$ is an cocartesian fibration if and only if
$B$ has pushouts.

**Exercise.** Prove that the total category {%ref 000A%} of $\overline{B}$ is the
arrow category $B^{\to}$, and the projection is the *domain* functor.
