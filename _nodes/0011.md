title: The full internal subcategory associated to a displayed object
---

The full internal subfibration {%pref 0010%} associated to a displayed object $\bar{u}$ of a locally small cartesian fibration $E$ over $B$ can be seen to be equivalent to the externalization
of an internal category $\gl{\bar{u}}$ in $B$. In particular, we let the object of objects $\gl{\bar{u}}\Sub{0}$ be $u$ itself; defining the object of arrows $\gl{\bar{u}}\Sub{1}$ is more complex, making critical use of the local smalness of $E$ over $B$.

We will think of the fiber $E\Sub{u\times u}$ as the category of
objects indexed in the *boundary* (source and target) of a morphism. Restricting $\bar{u}$ along the source and target projections, we obtain the displayed objects of "points of the source" and "points of the target" respectively:

\DiagramSquare{
  height = 1.5cm,
  nw/style = pullback,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  nw = \bar{\partial}\Sub{1},
  sw = u\times u,
  se = u,
  ne = \bar{u},
  south = \pi\Sub{1},
  north = \bar{\pi}\Sub{1},
}
\qquad
\DiagramSquare{
  height = 1.5cm,
  nw/style = pullback,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  nw = \bar{\partial}\Sub{2},
  sw = u\times u,
  se = u,
  ne = \bar{u},
  south = \pi\Sub{2},
  north = \bar{\pi}\Sub{2},
}
{%endtex%}

Because $E$ is locally small, there is an object
$\brk{\bar\partial\Sub{1},\bar\partial\Sub{2}}\in \Sl{B}{u\times u}$ that
behaves as the "generic hom set". We define $\gl{\bar{u}}\Sub{1}\in B$ and its
source and target projections to be this very object.
