A displayed category $E$ over $B$ is a *discrete right fibration* when for each
morphism $f:x\to y$ and displayed object $\bar{y}\in E\Sub{y}$, there exists a unique pair
of $\bar{x}\in E\Sub{x}$ and $\bar{f}:\bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$.

Whereas cartesian fibrations correspond to categories indexed pseudofunctorially by a
category, discrete right fibrations are an important special case corresponding to
presheaves: sets indexed by a category.

**Exercise.** Prove that every discrete right fibration is a cartesian fibration.

For any category $E$ displayed over $B$, the collection of objects $E\Sub{b}$ over $b\in
B$ has the structure of a category {%ref 0005 %}. If $E$ is a discrete right
fibration over $B$, then its fiber categories are *discrete*: their only morphisms
are the displayed identities.

From any discrete right fibration, we obtain a functor $B\to\OpCat{\SET}$
sending each $x\in B$ to the set $E\Sub{x}$ and each $f:x\to y$ in $B$ to the
function $E\Sub{y}\to E\Sub{x}$ in $\SET$ that sends $\bar{y}\in E\Sub{y}$ to
the domain of the unique displayed morphism $\bar{f}$.
