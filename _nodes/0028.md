title: The gluing fibration
---

Let $f : E \to F$ be a morphism of geometric universes; the properties of such
a morphism are profitably accessed through its *gluing fibration* $\GL{f}$ over $E$, obtained as the base change {%ref 0007%} along the inverse image $\InvImg{f} : E \to F$ of the fundamental self-indexing {%ref 0003%} of $F$.
