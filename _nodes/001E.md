title: Generic object
---

Let $E$ be a cartesian fibration over $B$; a *generic object* for $E$ is defined to be an object $\bar{u}\in \TotCat{E}$  such that for any $\bar{z}\in \TotCat{E}$ there exists a cartesian map $\bar{z}\to \bar{u}$.

**Warning.** Our terminology differs from that of Jacobs {%cite jacobs:1999 -A%}; what we refer to as a *generic object* here is Jacobs' *weak generic object*. We prefer the unqualified terminology, as generic objects in the stronger sense are very rare.
