title: Displayed categories from functors
---

In many cases, one starts with a functor $P:E\to B$; if it were meaningful to
speak of *equality* of objects in an arbitrary category then there would be an
obvious construction of a displayed category $P\Sub{\bullet}$ from $P$; we would
simply set $P\Sub{x}$ to be the collection of objects $u\in E$ such that $Pu=x$. As
it stands there is a more subtle version that will coincide up to categorical
equivalence with the naïve one in all cases that the latter is meaningful.

1. We define an object of $P\Sub{x}$ to be be a pair $(u,\phi\Sub{u})$ where $i\in E$ and
   $\phi\Sub{u} : Pu\cong x$. It is good to visualize such a pair as a "crooked
   leg" like so:
«
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
\node (u) {$u$};
\node (Pu) [below = 1cm of u] {$Pu$};
\node (x) [right = 1.5cm of Pu] {$x$};
\draw[lies over] (u) to (Pu);
\draw[->] (Pu) to node [below] {$\phi\Sub{u}$} (x);
\end{tikzpicture}
»

2. A morphism $(u,\phi\Sub{u})\to\Sub{f} (v,\phi\Sub{v})$ over $f : x \to y$ is given by
   a morphism $h : u\to v$ that lies over $f$ modulo the isomorphisms
   $\phi\Sub{u},\phi\Sub{v}$ in sense depicted below:
«
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
\node (pu) {$Pu$};
\node (pv) [right = of pu] {$Pv$};
\node (x) [below left = 1.5cm of pu] {$x$};
\node (y) [below right = 1.5cm of pv] {$y$};
\node (u) [above = 1.5cm of pu] {$u$};
\node (v) [above = 1.5cm of pv] {$v$};
\draw[lies over] (u) to (pu);
\draw[lies over] (v) to (pv);
\draw[->] (u) to node [above] {$h$} (v);
\draw[->] (x) to node [sloped,above] {$\phi\Sub{u}\Sup{-1}$} (pu);
\draw[->] (pu) to node [upright desc] {$Ph$} (pv);
\draw[->] (pv) to node [sloped,above] {$\phi\Sub{v}$} (y);
\draw[->,bend right=30] (x) to node [below] {$f$} (y);
\end{tikzpicture}
»

**Exercise.** Suppose that $B$ is an internal category in $\mathbf{Set}$, i.e.
it has a set of objects. Exhibit an equivalence of displayed categories between
$P\Sub{\bullet}$ as described above, and the naïve definition which $E\Sub{x}$ is the
collection of objects $u\in E$ such that $Pu = x$.


We have a functor $\TotCat{P\Sub{\bullet}}\to E$ taking a pair $(x,(u,\phi\Sub{u}))$ to
$u$.

**Exercise.** Explicitly construct the functorial action of $\TotCat{P\Sub{\bullet}}\to E$.

**Exercise.** Verify that $\TotCat{P\Sub{\bullet}}\to E$ is a categorical equivalence.
