title: "Example: the canonical-self-indexing"
---

Let $B$ be an ordinary category; there is a canonical displayed category
$\SelfIx{B}$ over $B$ given fiberwise by the *slices* of $B$.
1. For $x\in B$, we define $\SelfIx{B}\Sub{x}$ to be the collection $\Sl{B}{x}$
   of pairs $(\bar{x}\in B,p\Sub{x}:\bar{x}\to x)$.
2. For $f : x\to y\in B$, we define $\SelfIx{B}\Sub{f}$ to be the collection of
   commuting squares in the following configuration:
«
  \DiagramSquare{
    height = 1.7cm,
    nw = \bar{x},
    ne = \bar{y},
    sw = x,
    se = y,
    west = p\Sub{x},
    east = p\Sub{y},
    south = f,
    north = \bar{f},
    west/style = exists,
    east/style = exists,
    north/style = exists,
  }
»

**Exercise.** Prove that $\SelfIx{B}$ is a cartesian fibration if and only if $B$ has pullbacks.
