Let $E$ be a cartesian fibration over $B$; we saw in {%cref 0010%} that any
object $\bar{s}\in E\Sub{s}$ can be thought of as the generic object for a full
subfibration $\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}\subseteq E$, namely the class of objects
$\bar{z}\in E$ for which there exists a cartesian map $\bar{z}\to \bar{s}$.
We now develop the following vocabulary:

1. We will refer to each object of $\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}$ as a $\bar{s}$-figure
shape.

2. A displayed morphism $\bar{z}\to \bar{x}$ is called a $\bar{s}$-figure
   whenever $\bar{z}\in\FullSubfib{\bar{s}}$.

3. A pair of displayed morphisms $f,g:\bar{x}\to \bar{y}$ are said to *agree on
   $\bar{s}$-figures* when for any $\bar{s}$-figure $h : \bar{z}\to \bar{x}$,
   we have $h;f = h;g : \bar{z}\to \bar{y}$.
