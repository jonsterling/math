Let $E$ be a cartesian fibration in the sense of {%ref 0002%}, and let
$\bar{f} : \bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$ be displayed over $f:x\to y$. The
displayed morphism $\bar{f}$ is cartesian if and only if it is hypocartesian.

**Proof.**
Any cartesian map is clearly hypocartesian. To see that a hypocartesian map
$\bar{f}:\bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$ in a cartesian fibration is cartesian, we
consider the cartesian lift of $f:x\to y$ under $\bar{y}$:
«
\DiagramSquare{
  height = 1.5cm,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  nw/style = pullback,
  nw = \bar{x}\tick,
  ne = \bar{y},
  se = y,
  sw = x,
  south = f,
  north = \bar{f}\tick,
  north/style = {->,exists},
}
»

As the cartesian lift $\bar{x}\tick\to \bar{y}$ is also hypocartesian, it
follows that there is a unique vertical isomorphism identifying $\bar{x}$ with
$\bar{x}\tick$ factoring $\bar{f} : \bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$ through
$\bar{f}\tick : \bar{x}\tick\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$. Being cartesian over $f$ is clearly
stable under isomorphism, hence we conclude that $\bar{f}$ is cartesian from
the fact that $\bar{f}\tick$ is cartesian.
