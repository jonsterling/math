title: Finite colimits, natural numbers objects, and logical functors

Note that any geometric universe has finite colimits, which can be constructed using the subobject classifier. A logical morphism between geometric universes necessarily preserves finite colimits for this reasons. Using Freyd's characterization of natural numbers objects in terms of a coequalization property, it follows that logical morphisms also preserve the natural numbers object.
