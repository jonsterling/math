title: Separators for cartesian fibrations
---

Let $E$ be an ordinary category. In general,
to compare two morphisms $f,g:x\to y$ in $E$, it is not enough to see if they
agree on global points $u:1\to x$, because the behavior of $u,v$ may differ
only on generalized elements. In some cases, however, there is a family of
objects $\prn{s\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}\in E$ are together *adequate* for comparing
morphisms of $E$ in the sense of {%cref 002G%} below.

@include{002G}

The intuition of {%cref 002G%} is that to compare two morphisms $f,g:x\to y\in E$,
it suffices to check that they behave the same on all $s\Sub{i}$-shaped figures
when $\prn{s\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}$ is a separating family for $E$.

@include{002F}

We will now generalize {%cref 002G%} to the case of a cartesian fibration.
