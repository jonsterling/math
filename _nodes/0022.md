TODO: introduce discrete left fibrations and opposites before this, to avoid the ops?

An important example is the *classifying discrete right fibration* of $\PtSET$ over
$\OpCat{\SET}$, defined as follows:

1. For $X\in\OpCat{\SET}$, we define $\PtSET\brk{X}$ to be the collection of elements $x\in X$.
2. For $f:Y\to X\in\OpCat{\SET}$, we define $\PtSET\brk{f}(y,x)$ to be $\brc{\star \mid f(x) = y}$.

To verify this is a discrete right fibration, note that for any $f:Y\to X$ and $x\in
\PtSET\brk{X}$, there is a unique element of $\PtSET\brk{Y}$ equal to $f(x)$, namely $f(x)$.

**Exercise.** Prove that the total category $\TotCat{\PtSET}$ {%ref 000A %} is
$\OpCat{\SET\Sub{\bullet}}$ and the projection functor is the forgetful functor
$\OpCat{\SET\Sub{\bullet}}\to\OpCat{\SET}$.

We say that $\PtSET$ over $\OpCat{\SET}$ is the classifying discrete right fibration
because *all* discrete right fibrations arise via change of base {%ref 0007 %} from
$\PtSET$.

**Lemma.** Let $F:B\to\OpCat{\SET}$ be a functor; then $\InvImg{F}\PtSET$ is a
discrete right fibration over $B$.

**Lemma.** Let $E$ be a discrete right fibration over $B$, and let
$F:B\to\OpCat{\SET}$ be the functor constructed from $E$ as in {%ref 0021 %}. Then
$E$ can be reconstructed as $\InvImg{F}\PtSET$.
