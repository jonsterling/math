A *geometric universe* $E$ is defined to be a cartesian closed category
equipped with a subobject classifier. A morphism $f : E \to F$ of geometric
universes is given by a functor $\InvImg{f}:F\to E$ preserving finite limits equipped
with a right adjoint $\DirImg{f}: E\to F$.  A 2-morphism $f\to g$ is given by a
natural transformation $\InvImg{f}\to \InvImg{g}$, or equivalently, a natural transformation $\DirImg{g}\to\DirImg{f}$.

The left adjoint $\InvImg{f} : F \to E$ is called the *inverse image* and the right adjoint $\DirImg{f} : E \to F$ is called the *direct image*.
